# Online_Retail_System
The Online Retail System project aims to create an e-commerce platform with functionalities similar to eBay, focusing on a limited set of use cases. The project also has the potential to incorporate a recommender system to enhance the customer experience. The system will have two primary roles: Customers and Store Owners.
